    <h3> 2.1) Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you

    <h3>2.4) Describe further improvements you can make to your project </h3>
</div>
Look for ways to improve visibility and awareness. Often, one of the biggest reasons for a project or a team falling
behind schedule can be tied back . Lines such as “I thought I had more time” or “I didn’t realise the impact delaying
this one task would have” can be all too common without a system that keeps everyone in the loop. Software that can
regularly notify the team of changes or responsibilities can make all the difference.
<div>
    Don’t over complicate your projects. If projects are too big and contain too much information and too many lines,
    users will have trouble creating, navigating and updating them. This process should be quick and easy, and it should
    ultimately streamline your processes, not make them more difficult. Keeping things simple can be the difference
    between your team loathing a tool and loving a tool.

    <div>
        When introducing a new website ,face the challenge of understanding which browsers and devices we use to prove
        that
        the website is accessible.
        It is critical that clients’ customer base can use the website with their specific device and browser type. As
        we
        know, there is a myriad of combinations that an end user could have when factoring browser types, browser
        versions,
        device types and operating systems and there is a risk that a set of end users may not be able to access or use
        the
        website as it is intended
