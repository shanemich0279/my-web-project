           <h3> Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?<h3>
     </p>       
    </div>
           Risk management is about maximising your chances of project success by identifying risks early on and planning how to manage them.

    </div>Most Common Project Risks
     <div> Cost risk, typically escalation of project costs due to poor cost estimating accuracy and scope creep.
             <div>
          Schedule risk, the risk that activities will take longer than expected.
          <div>
          Performance risk, the risk that the project will fail to produce results consistent with project specifications.

           <h3> Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h3>
    </p>       
   </div>
            Focus on Your Pain Points

     </div>   Fundamentally, technology is a tool that helps you do what you do better, faster, or more efficiently. The key to choosing the right technology for your business is to understand what you’re already doing well, and what you need to do better.
     <div>    Figuring out your company’s biggest pain points is the key to knowing where you can improve, and that process starts with talking to your team. First and foremost, you want to know how would you spend time each day. A good place to start is to ask everyone to take a moment to estimate how much time you will devote to various, but specific activities each week. Make sure that you’re clear that you’re looking for company-wide trends, not scrutinising individual employees’ time management. 
    </div>    Once you have that data, you should look for information that might surprise you. Are people spending an inordinate amount of time just catching up on email? That might point to a need for a more efficient communication or collaboration solution for your team. Are slow internet and Wi-Fi speeds creating bottlenecks and slowing down your day-to-day operations? A scalable internet solution that will grow with your business may be the answer.\

           <h2> Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h2>
    </p> 
</div>

    </div>Over the last couple of years anyone involved in business, especially in Europe, will have heard of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (known as GDPR).  This is designed to protect the data of individuals with a compliance date of 25 May 2018
    <div>

     <h3></h3>Legal Constraints, Guidelines & Procedures</h3>
   </div>
The Internet is a wonderful source of information and entertainment, but it’s important to realise that there are a number of restrictions on what you can and cannot do online.
There are significant legal constraints on the uploading and downloading of software and other digital content, including music and videos. Many items are copyright and can incorporate digital rights management, such as restricting the number of times a media file can be copied or converted to another format. When you buy software, you will  normally receive a licence to use it. You do not own the software itself, nor do you have the right to copy it. Some types of licence, including freeware and shareware impose fewer restrictions.
<div>
</div>Legal constraints on online behaviour include protection of children legislation which prohibits grooming and inappropriate behaviour towards minors. You should ensure that you are familiar with the rules of “netiquette” which describes the recommended conduct of users in various online environments. Remember that libellous behaviour is subject to the same restrictions (and penalties) whether it is online or offline.
<div>      
</div>You should always ensure that you observe the correct guidelines and procedures for safe use of the Internet. It is not sufficient to know about guidelines
